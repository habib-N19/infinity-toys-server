# Infinity Toy Store server side

Welcome to the Infinity Toy Store Server repository! This project demonstrates an Express server with MongoDB integration, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and exposing a RESTful API. Below you will find information about the key features and instructions to get started.

## Key Features

- Express: The server is built using Express, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express provides a robust set of features for building web applications and APIs.

- MongoDB Integration: This server integrates with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. It demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations using the MongoDB Node.js driver or an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library like Mongoose.

- RESTful API: The server implements a RESTful API architecture, allowing clients to interact with the server through standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
